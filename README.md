# EaterSFHeatmap


This Ruby Gem will scrape Eater SF's Heatmap page and display the current restaurants on the heat map and their address.

Ex. 1. My Eatery - 1234 Main St., San Francisco, CA 94101

The user will then be prompted to choose a number of the restaurant they want more information about.

Ex. "My Eatery produces Spanish-inspired cuisine, locally sourced, with a menu that changes weekly."
